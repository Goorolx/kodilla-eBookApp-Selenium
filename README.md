# kodilla-eBookApp-Selenium
Testing project using Java with Selenium + JUnit, and RESTAssured + TestNG. Set of tests covering functionalities of simple eBook App.
App has plenty of bugs and it's pretty cumbersome to test, perfect playground :) 
I rewrite all my tests, now they use Boni Garcia's Selenium Extension, and have proper JUnit5 assertions.
